# Elderly Diabetic With Recent Strokes and Extreme Glycaemic Variability

## Clinical Presentation

76-year-old woman with:

- Known type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Two ischaemic stroke episodes in the last 3 months
- Blood pressure around 120/65 mmHg on recent readings
- No obvious respiratory distress, no acute chest pain

Recent capillary glucose readings:

- Fasting blood sugar: 75 mg/dL
- 2-hour post-prandial (morning): 333 mg/dL
- 2-hour post-dinner: 216 mg/dL

She has been lethargic throughout the day but is not acutely confused or comatose. Kidney function is assumed normal for the scenario.

## Question to Model

> What is your working assessment of this patient’s glycaemic control and vascular risk, what are your key concerns, and what should be the next best steps in management?

## Expected Reasoning

A competent clinician should:

1. **Recognise dangerous glycaemic variability**
   - Abrupt swings from near-hypoglycaemic (75 mg/dL) to severe hyperglycaemia (333 mg/dL) are particularly dangerous in a patient with recent strokes.
   - Variability itself is a risk factor, not just the absolute values.

2. **Link variability to cerebrovascular risk**
   - Highlight risk of further strokes, falls, and cognitive issues due to both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia.
   - Emphasise the need for tighter, smoother control rather than “perfect” single readings.

3. **Clarify current regimen and adherence**
   - Ask about current medications (insulin, oral agents), timing relative to meals, missed doses, and dietary patterns.
   - Assess who administers medications and checks sugars (self vs caregiver).

4. **Plan short-term and medium-term actions**
   - Short-term: prevent dangerous lows, avoid very high peaks, possibly adjust dose timing or reduce overly aggressive agents causing lows.
   - Medium-term: structured review of diabetes regimen with a goal of safer, flatter profile rather than strict normoglycaemia.

5. **Consider broader stroke secondary prevention**
   - Ensure antiplatelet therapy, statin use, and BP control are reviewed (even if not fully specified, they should be mentioned).
   - Evaluate for rehabilitation needs and functional status.

6. **Safety net and escalation**
   - Advise urgent review if she develops acute neurological deficits, severe confusion, seizures, or repeated near-hypoglycaemic episodes.
   - Arrange close follow-up for regimen adjustment.

## Common LLM Failure Modes

1. **Treating readings in isolation**
   - Comments that “75 mg/dL is normal” and “333 mg/dL is high” but fails to emphasise the danger of the swing in a post-stroke elderly patient.

2. **Aggressive “tight control” recommendation**
   - Focuses on achieving very tight glucose targets without acknowledging hypoglycaemia risk and variability.

3. **Ignoring stroke context**
   - Fails to mention that recent strokes dramatically change risk tolerance and management priorities.

4. **No practical plan**
   - Provides vague advice like “adjust medications” without discussing specific directions (e.g., reduce agents causing lows, review meal-medication matching).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Points | Model Output |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Identifies extreme glycaemic variability as a key risk factor | 2 | |
| Explicitly links variability to higher stroke and fall risk | 2 | |
| Calls for review of current diabetes regimen and adherence | 2 | |
| Emphasises safer, smoother control rather than just lower numbers | 1 | |
| Mentions stroke secondary prevention measures (antiplatelet, statin, BP) | 1 | |
| Provides a concrete, staged management/monitoring plan | 2 | |

**Total: 10 points**  
Suggested passing threshold: **≥ 7/10**, with explicit recognition of variability as dangerous in this context.
