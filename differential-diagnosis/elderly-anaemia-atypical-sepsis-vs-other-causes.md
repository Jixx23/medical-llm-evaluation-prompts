# Elderly Patient With Anaemia and Possible Atypical Sepsis

## Clinical Presentation

70-year-old woman with known type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with:

- Recent history of progressive fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance
- Documented drop in packed cell volume (PCV) / haemoglobin over time (gradual decline rather than sudden crash)
- Poor glycaemic control historically (fasting blood sugars often around 150 mg/dL or higher)
- Intermittent non-specific symptoms (e.g., mild dizziness), but no clear localising signs
- No reported history of:
  - High fever or rigors
  - Marked hypothermia
  - Overt respiratory distress
  - Focal neurological deficits
- No clear source of blood loss described (no overt GI bleeding, no heavy PV bleeding)

You are concerned about the possibility of infection and sepsis with a **blunted febrile response**, given her age and diabetic status.

## Question to Model

> What is your working diagnosis and differential diagnosis for this patient’s anaemia and systemic state, and how would you evaluate for possible atypical sepsis in the context of diabetes and a blunted febrile response?

## Expected Reasoning

A competent clinician should:

1. **Recognise risk of atypical sepsis presentation**
   - Elderly, diabetic patients may have muted fever and “soft” signs of sepsis.
   - Look for tachycardia, tachypnoea, hypotension, acute confusion, and abnormal labs rather than relying solely on temperature.

2. **Outline a differential diagnosis for anaemia**
   - Anaemia of chronic disease (inflammatory/infective, CKD, etc.).
   - Iron deficiency anaemia (occult GI loss, nutritional).
   - B12/folate deficiency.
   - Bone marrow disorders (less common but important in older adults).
   - Haemolysis if suggested by labs or clinical features.

3. **Include possible chronic/occult infection**
   - UTIs, chest infections, skin/soft tissue infections, diabetic foot, intra-abdominal sources.
   - Recognise that subacute or chronic infection can drive anaemia and systemic inflammation.

4. **Link diabetes and autonomic neuropathy to blunted fever**
   - Explain how chronic diabetes and autonomic dysfunction can reduce classical febrile response.
   - Emphasise that **absence of fever does not exclude serious infection**.

5. **Plan appropriate investigations**
   - Full blood count, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear.
   - Basic metabolic panel, renal function, LFTs.
   - Inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR) if available.
   - Blood cultures if sepsis suspected.
   - Urinalysis / urine culture, chest X-ray, review of feet and skin.
   - Stool occult blood testing and GI evaluation if iron deficiency suspected.

6. **Outline management priorities**
   - Stabilise if haemodynamically compromised.
   - Address any identified infection early (antibiotics, source control).
   - Optimise blood glucose control in conjunction with infection management.
   - Tailor anaemia treatment (iron, B12, transfusion, etc.) to underlying cause.

## Common LLM Failure Modes

1. **Fever-centric sepsis reasoning**
   - Treats absence of fever as near-exclusion of sepsis in an elderly diabetic.

2. **Superficial anaemia workup**
   - Says “check iron and give supplements” without a proper differential or search for chronic disease/occult blood loss.

3. **Handwaving about diabetes**
   - Mentions diabetes but does not connect it to atypical infection presentations or autonomic neuropathy.

4. **Guideline dumping without prioritisation**
   - Lists many tests but fails to articulate what must be done early (vital signs, lactate, cultures, etc.).

5. **Overconfident reassurance**
   - Minimises risk with phrases suggesting “low concern” despite multiple red flags (elderly, diabetic, anaemic, progressive decline).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Points | Model Output |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Recognises that elderly diabetics can have blunted febrile response | 2 | |
| Lists a reasonable differential diagnosis for anaemia (≥3 categories) | 2 | |
| Explicitly considers chronic or occult infection as a contributor | 1 | |
| Suggests a structured evaluation for sepsis beyond just temperature | 2 | |
| Links infection, inflammation, and anaemia in reasoning | 1 | |
| Provides a basic but coherent investigation and management plan | 2 | |

**Total: 10 points**  
Suggested passing threshold: **≥ 7/10**, with explicit acknowledgment that normal temperature does **not** exclude sepsis here.
