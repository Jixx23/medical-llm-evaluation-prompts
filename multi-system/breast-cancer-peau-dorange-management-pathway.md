# Breast Cancer With Peau d’Orange – Next Best Management Step

## Clinical Presentation

43-year-old multiparous woman presents with:

- Painful left breast lump present for about 7 months
- Recent development (about 1 week) of peau d’orange appearance over the affected breast
- No headaches, no loss of consciousness
- No signs of meningeal irritation
- No back pain, no limb weakness or paralysis
- No chronic cough, no chest pain, no dyspnoea
- No jaundice, no significant weight loss reported (can be varied according to scenario)
- Tru-cut biopsy has been done and histology confirms malignancy of the left breast (assume invasive carcinoma for this scenario)

You are working in a setting where oncology services exist but access can be delayed; however, basic imaging and surgery are available.

## Question to Model

> What is the next best line of management for this patient, and what staging and multidisciplinary steps should be undertaken before definitive treatment?

## Expected Reasoning

A competent clinician should:

1. **Recognise locally advanced breast cancer features**
   - Long-standing lump + peau d’orange are highly concerning.
   - Histology confirming malignancy removes diagnostic uncertainty.

2. **Emphasise staging before definitive therapy**
   - Local staging: breast imaging and axillary assessment.
   - Distant staging: chest imaging, abdominal ultrasound/CT, bone scan or equivalent if available.
   - Assess performance status and comorbidities.

3. **Involve multidisciplinary team (MDT)**
   - Breast surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, radiologist, pathologist.
   - Case discussion to plan sequencing (e.g. neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs upfront surgery).

4. **Outline likely management pathways**
   - In many such cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered to downstage disease before surgery.
   - Mastectomy ± axillary clearance or sentinel node procedures depending on resources and stage.
   - Adjuvant radiotherapy and systemic therapy depending on receptor status (ER/PR/HER2) if available.

5. **Address symptom control and counselling**
   - Pain management, psychological support.
   - Clear communication about diagnosis, prognosis, and the need for staging.

## Common LLM Failure Modes

1. **Jumping straight to mastectomy without staging**
   - Suggests immediate surgery without commenting on systemic staging or MDT input.

2. **Ignoring peau d’orange significance**
   - Treats peau d’orange as a minor symptom rather than sign of locally advanced disease.

3. **Guideline dumping without sequencing**
   - Lists all possible treatments (chemo, surgery, radiotherapy) but does not specify order or dependency on stage/receptor status.

4. **No mention of resource context**
   - Recommends advanced targeted therapies as if universally available, without offering more basic options when resources are limited.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Points | Model Output |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Recognises this as likely locally advanced breast cancer | 2 | |
| Recommends appropriate staging investigations before definitive therapy | 2 | |
| Mentions MDT involvement and sequencing (e.g. neoadjuvant chemo vs surgery) | 2 | |
| Provides at least one reasonable management pathway given limited but present oncology resources | 2 | |
| Addresses symptom control and communication/counselling | 1 | |

**Total: 9 points**  
Suggested passing threshold: **≥ 6/9**, with mandatory staging before definitive therapy.
