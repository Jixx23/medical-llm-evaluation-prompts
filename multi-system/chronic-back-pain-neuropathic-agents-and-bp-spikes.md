# Chronic Low Back Pain, Neuropathic Agents, and Blood Pressure Spikes

## Clinical Presentation

60-year-old woman with:

- Chronic low back pain attributed to lumbar spondylosis
- Long-standing hypertension on multiple agents
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus

Pain management history:

- Pregabalin was previously started for neuropathic pain but later stopped.
- Tizanidine was used as a muscle relaxant but also stopped after complaints of dizziness.
- Lamotrigine was initiated for neuropathic pain, with good reduction in painful flares.

Blood pressure history:

- On a regimen including Amlodipine, Lisinopril, Indapamide, and low-dose Spironolactone.
- BP rose to around 140/80 mmHg over one week (from better baseline control).
- After adjustments (e.g. adding or titrating Spironolactone), BP improved back towards ~126/81 mmHg.

Key observations:

- Dizziness episodes improved after stopping Pregabalin and Tizanidine.
- Pain flares largely controlled on Lamotrigine.
- BP may worsen when sedating agents cause reduced activity or when regimen changes are poorly coordinated.

## Question to Model

> How would you reason about the relationship between neuropathic pain medications, blood pressure control, and dizziness in this patient, and what principles should guide ongoing co-management of chronic pain and hypertension?

## Expected Reasoning

A competent clinician should:

1. **Recognise polypharmacy and CNS effects**
   - Pregabalin and Tizanidine can cause dizziness, sedation, and falls, particularly in older hypertensive patients.
   - Sedation may indirectly affect activity levels and BP control.

2. **Separate pain control from haemodynamic management**
   - Pain and autonomic stress can raise BP.
   - Over-sedation can cause falls and orthostatic symptoms.
   - Both under-treated pain and excessive CNS suppression are dangerous.

3. **Discuss safer neuropathic pain strategies**
   - Lamotrigine (off-label in some settings) may help neuropathic pain but requires monitoring for rash and CNS effects.
   - Start low, go slow, and regularly reassess function and side effects.

4. **Integrate with hypertension management**
   - Monitor BP and symptoms when initiating or changing CNS-active drugs.
   - Avoid making simultaneous large changes in both antihypertensives and CNS agents when possible, to preserve interpretability.
   - Recheck labs and orthostatics if dizziness or BP swings occur.

5. **Emphasise shared decision-making and follow-up**
   - Discuss trade-offs clearly with the patient (pain relief vs alertness vs BP control).
   - Arrange regular reviews to adjust both pain and BP regimens.

## Common LLM Failure Modes

1. **Treating pain and BP in isolation**
   - Discusses chronic pain management without acknowledging its interaction with BP and falls risk.

2. **Ignoring CNS side effects**
   - Minimises or fails to mention the risk of dizziness, sedation, falls, or cognitive slowing with Pregabalin/Tizanidine.

3. **No timeline or monitoring plan**
   - Suggests adding/adjusting drugs but does not specify when to review BP, symptoms, or labs.

4. **Overly rigid guideline focus**
   - Recommends first-line neuropathic agents without considering prior trials and tolerability in this specific patient.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Points | Model Output |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Recognises CNS side effects (dizziness, sedation, falls) of neuropathic agents | 2 | |
| Links pain control, stress, and BP dynamics | 2 | |
| Emphasises cautious titration and monitoring when combining CNS drugs with antihypertensives | 2 | |
| Suggests a follow-up/monitoring plan including BP and symptom review | 2 | |
| Mentions patient-centred discussion of trade-offs | 1 | |

**Total: 9 points**  
Suggested passing threshold: **≥ 6/9**, with explicit recognition of CNS side effects and monitoring needs.
