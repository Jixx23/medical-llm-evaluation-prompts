# 28-Year-Old With Mid-Cycle PV Bleeding (Cervicitis vs Others)

## Clinical Presentation

28-year-old woman presents with:

- 3-day history of blood stains on panties
- Dark red to brown smears on underwear
- Brighter red blood on toilet seat when she urinates
- No frank blood seen in the urine itself
- Occasional sharp, brief lower abdominal pains in the days before onset
- No fever
- No dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency
- No passage of clots per rectum, no rectal bleeding
- Last normal menstrual period ended 5 days before onset of this bleeding
- Menses usually regular; next menses expected in about 2 weeks
- No recent use of emergency contraception
- No unprotected penetrative intercourse in the last month
- Partner has a history of multiple sexual partners
- No prior pelvic imaging available

Setting: resource-limited outpatient clinic.

## Question to Model

> What is your working diagnosis, what are your key differentials, and what is the next best line of management in this setting?

## Expected Reasoning

A competent clinician should:

1. **Clarify the true source of bleeding**
   - Distinguish vaginal vs urinary vs rectal origin with targeted questions and exam.
   - Note that blood on panties and toilet seat, with clear urine, is more consistent with genital tract bleeding.

2. **Construct a focused differential diagnosis**
   - Cervicitis / early pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), given:
     - Intermenstrual bleeding
     - Lower abdominal discomfort
     - High-risk sexual history (promiscuous partner)
   - Ovulatory / mid-cycle bleeding as a benign cause.
   - Early pregnancy-related bleeding (though less likely with no recent unprotected sex, still worth excluding).
   - Structural lesions (cervical polyp, ectropion, less likely malignancy in this age group but must be kept in mind).

3. **Plan investigations appropriate to setting**
   - Pregnancy test (urine hCG) to rule out pregnancy-related bleeding.
   - Speculum exam to look for cervical lesions, friability, discharge.
   - Bimanual exam to assess cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness or masses.
   - STI testing if available (chlamydia, gonorrhoea), or empirical treatment based on risk.

4. **Formulate a working diagnosis**
   - Likely cervicitis or early PID in this context, *after* excluding pregnancy.
   - Document reasoning rather than jumping to one label.

5. **Management and safety net**
   - Appropriate antibiotic regimen for suspected cervicitis / PID as per local guidelines.
   - Counsel abstinence or condom use until treatment completed; treat partner(s) if possible.
   - Clear red-flag advice: worsening pain, fever, heavy bleeding, syncope, or positive pregnancy test → urgent review.
   - Arrange follow-up to reassess symptoms and adherence.

## Common LLM Failure Modes

1. **Anchoring on a single benign diagnosis**
   - Labels this as “normal mid-cycle spotting” without:
     - Adequate STI/PID consideration.
     - Any safety net or follow-up.

2. **Poor source-of-bleeding reasoning**
   - Confuses urinary vs vaginal vs rectal source, despite details given.
   - Fails to suggest speculum exam or simple confirmatory questions.

3. **Pregnancy handwaving**
   - Either ignores pregnancy entirely or implies that pregnancy is “ruled out” without recommending a test.

4. **Non-contextual guideline dumping**
   - Suggests sophisticated diagnostics (colposcopy, pelvic MRI) without recognising a low-resource outpatient context.

5. **Overconfident tone**
   - Presents a single diagnosis with high certainty despite limited data and multiple plausible differentials.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Points | Model Output |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Distinguishes likely vaginal source from urinary/rectal | 1 | |
| Lists at least 2 plausible differentials (e.g. cervicitis/PID, ovulatory bleeding, pregnancy-related) | 2 | |
| Recommends a pregnancy test before excluding pregnancy causes | 1 | |
| Suggests appropriate genital exam (speculum ± bimanual) | 1 | |
| Considers STI/PID in light of sexual history and bleeding pattern | 2 | |
| Provides clear safety-net advice and follow-up plan | 1 | |
| Avoids overconfident, single-line diagnosis | 1 | |

**Total: 9 points**  
Suggested passing threshold: **≥ 6/9** with no critical safety misses (pregnancy and STI/PID both considered).
